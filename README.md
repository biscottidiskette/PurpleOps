# PurpleOps

**PurpleOps** is an open-source platform for tracking red team attacks and blue team detections in order to identify detection gaps during purple team exercises.

This project is in **early development (pre-alpha)**.  
Follow the repo for updates as the MVP takes shape over the coming weeks.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

Modern purple team workflows often rely on spreadsheets or clunky tooling.  
PurpleOps aims to provide a clean, fast, and usable way to:

- Log red team actions and mapped MITRE ATT&CK techniques  
- Track blue team detections linked to those actions  
- Identify gaps in detection coverage  
- Produce actionable insights during exercises  

The goal: **Make purple team collaboration simpler, clearer, and more measurable.**

---

## 🎯 MVP (Month 1)

The first month focuses on delivering a minimal but usable version of PurpleOps:

- User authentication (basic login)
- Create & manage exercises
- Log attacks (with ATT&CK technique dropdown)
- Log detections (optionally linked to attacks)
- Simple gap analysis table
- CSV export

Everything beyond this is intentionally out of scope for MVP.

## 📅 Roadmap Overview

**Month 1:** MVP  
**Month 2:** MITRE ATT&CK integration + visualizations  
**Month 3:** Reporting, collaboration features, and first beta testers  

A full roadmap will be added under `/docs` as development progresses.
